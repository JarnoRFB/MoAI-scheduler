A scheduler for the final project of the "Methods of AI" class in WS 2016/17.

The scheduler implements a classical constraint satisfaction solving approach. A backtracking search guided by a minimum-remaining-values heuristic and a least-constraining-value heuristic.

Some examples can be found in [demo.ipynb](https://github.com/JarnoRFB/MoAI-scheduler/blob/master/demo.ipynb).

To install the dependencies run
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

For the example problem from the lecture (unlikely to finish) run 
`python demo.py`
